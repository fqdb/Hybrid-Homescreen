Hybrid Homescreen is a work in progress Android launcher that tries to combine the UI of a conventional Android launcher with the UI of a launcher without an app drawer (hence the name). 

Hybrid Homescreen does have a dedicated app drawer, but it is much more integrated with the home screen than it is in conventional Android launchers.
